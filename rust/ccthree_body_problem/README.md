# Three Body Problem Simulation

A gravitational physics simulation that visualizes the chaotic motion of three celestial bodies under mutual gravitational attraction.

## Overview

This simulation demonstrates the classic three-body problem in celestial mechanics, where three bodies of comparable mass interact gravitationally. 
Unlike the two-body problem which has a closed-form solution, the three-body problem exhibits chaotic behavior that makes long-term prediction impossible without numerical simulation.
The simulation solves Newton's equation for three bodies. 

## Limitations

1. Numerical error accumulate over time.
2. Values have to be scaled.
